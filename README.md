# Hello world!  

Github tutorial

Welcome to my first github project. As you should be able to tell I am new to github.
That's why I am doing the tutorial (duuuh, haha). 

Here's a little information about my computer-self. 
- I enjoy coding
--- I have little experience, but I *do* have some.
  -- Mostly just goofing around in games, trying to modify them to my liking or find "exploits" that I can use in game level design. Besides that I have done some other minor projects, mostly to satisfy needs of my own. 

- My text editor is emacs, which I started using a few years ago since I thought it looked really cool.
--- Oh, and I've heard that emacs users are can not stop telling other people that they use it.
     I will try to avoid to become one of those guys, if at all possible... It might be too big a hurdle tho': I am filled to the brim with enthusiasm about it!

- I am a true novice in linux: my first proper experience with a linux distro was Arch (which is ironic if we look at my previous bullet point). I chose to begin with that because I wanted to learn how navigate the terminal, and understand the underlying workings of a computer OS. I am quite pleased with my choice this far, I've learned a bunch. And I still have lots to learn too! 

- I am usually able to find a solution to whatever I am trying to do.
 -- THANK YOU GOOGLE!
 -- Honestly though, I've realized that anyone can go google something. I strive to be good without outside help -- I figure that's the best way to evolve my problem solving muscles.. Hey! One day I might even be able to flex them a little :) 
 
 Well, that's my computer self, hope you enjoyed the read.
